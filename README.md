# actionable [![built with choo v6](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with%20choo-v6-ffc3e4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/choojs/choo)
A [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/)-inspired todo list that
lets you focus on immediately actionable tasks (tasks with no dependencies).

## default task list
Task dependencies are indicated by nesting.

Yes I know there are a lot of todo apps out there, and I've tried nearly all of
them. The only one with this feature that I've seen is OmniFocus, and only with
a good amount of configuration. I want this feature, so I'm building it. Maybe
other folks will want it too.
